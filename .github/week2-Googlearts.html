      <p>As an online platform for the public to explore art works and cultural artifacts virtually, 
          <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/" target="/blank">Google arts and Culture</a> cooperates with 
        a lot of museums and art institutions. In 2011, the initial stage of the platform, Google arts 
        culture is an innovative project out of google's employees' interests.In 2012, as the expansion
        of the project, 151 museums with more than 34000 artworks joined this project.

        In addition to browsing artworks online and visiting real museums virtually
        visitors can also create themed virtual museums dedicated to a specific painters or theme.
        Besides, there are also many interesting game projects on this webside, such as selfie filters which
        can make you look like a famous painting; <a id="puzzleparty">puzzle party</id>" which enables 
        people play puzzle with their family or friends; art coloring book which offer people opportunities
        recreat a masterpiece. As for me, I consider these games can help 
        visitors gain more knowledge behind the artworks and arouse thier interests in arts. They offer
        visitors more  </p>
