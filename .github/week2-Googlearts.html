      <h1>week2:google arts and culture</h1>
      <p>As an online platform for the public to explore art works and cultural artifacts virtually, 
          <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/" target="/blank">Google arts and Culture</a> cooperates with 
        a lot of museums and art institutions. In 2011, the initial stage of the platform, Google arts 
        culture is an innovative project out of google's employees' interests.In 2012, as the expansion
        of the project, 151 museums with more than 34000 artworks joined this project.
        <br>
        In addition to browsing artworks online and visiting real museums virtually
        visitors can also create themed virtual museums dedicated to a specific painters or theme.
        Besides, there are also many interesting game projects on this webside, such as <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/camera/art-filter" target="/blank">selfie filters</a> which
        can make you look like a famous painting; <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/experiment/puzzle-party/EwGBPZlIzv0KRw" target="/blank">puzzle party</a>" which enables 
        people play puzzle with their family or friends; <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/experiment/art-coloring-book/1QGsh6vSfAQBgQ" target="/blank">art coloring book</a> which offer people opportunities
        recreat a masterpiece. As for me, I consider these games can help 
        visitors gain more knowledge behind the artworks and arouse thier interests in arts. They offer
        visitors more possibilities to explore. The first time When I open google atrs and culture, it offers 
        visitors navigations to follow. In the homepage of the website, it offers tons of acivities for 
        visitors to join, you can explore a specific museums, play with your phone, play a art game, 
        realx with artworks and music,etc. On the left side of the webpage, there is a navigation bar
        where arrange different museums and artworks by many different 
        taxonomies; some of them are arranged by country, some of them are displayed by initials, some of them
        are arranged by colors, etc. visitors
        can explore these art treasures on thier own interests with the help of the navigation. Obviously,
        The website is made for the public, however, it also offer some advanced functions which are frequently 
        used by scholars. For instance, thanks to <strong>Google Street View 360</strong> and <strong>
        Clauss Rodeon VR Head Hd</strong>, people can have a microscope view on some piece of artworks.
        Besides, It also incorporates with other academic resources like <a href="http://scholar.google.com/">Google Scholar</a> 
        <br>
        In general, I think Google Arts and culture is like a museum of museums. Thanks to Googleâ€™s technology and employee's innovation
        the cooperation with many archives and museums, this website offers people opportunities to explore 
        fantastic art worlds at home. These huge archives also take some copyright issues with Google, I am not familair
        with law issues, but I find that Google change some property policy. ALthough there also exists some copyright issues now, and some
        people think it's Eurocentrism. As for me, athough there are indeed some problems exist, 
        I choose to stand at the positive side, I think
        it is a fantastic platform which makes art accesible and better understand.  </p>
