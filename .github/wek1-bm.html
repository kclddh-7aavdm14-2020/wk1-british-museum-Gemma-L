        <h1>：When and why this Archive created?</h1>
        <p>:As the first public national museum in the World, The British Museum eastablished in 1753 and open to the public in 1759.It documents the story of human cultures from the beginning to the present by many means. The reason it was originally eastablished is lie in the will of Sir Hans Sloane.</p>
        <h1>:Where did the objects from?</h1>
        <p>:Significant proportion of the British Museum's collection was donated or bequeathed to the museum. However, the foundation of the museum Closely related to British colonial expansion. As James Delbourgo prefered in his book 'Collecting the World: Hans Sloane and the Origins of the British Museum', Even the term 'museum' origins from the imperialist enlightenment. There are also  many collections in the British Museum still have problems of ownership until now. For instance, the Elgin Marbles of Greece and the Rosetta Stone of Egypt.      </p> 
        <h1>:Who is the archive made for?</h1>
        <p>:As a 'museum of the world', the British museum wants to 'Show the world to the world', Through the collection of the British Museum's cultural relics, The Britsh Museum wish the world can think about its common history and tell people the interconnectedness of cultures around the world. Therefore, the collections of the British Museum are open to audiences all over the world who are interested in culture and history. Everyone can visit their website for free, and they also have their own publishing press which publish books related to the exihbition and history.  It can also be found from the museum’s website that the museum hopes to spread the story and history behind the collection to people; for instance, there are 'blog' module written by different professional scholars aimes to share the history and stories about exhibies and 'people behind the collection' module which aims to introduce some collectors. All in all, I consider the museum is open for everyone from  everywhere   </p>      
        <h1>:Condition of possibility for this archive to exist?</h1>
        <p>:Nowadays, as a natinoal museum, The museum is a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. So people don't need to pay for visit except for loan exibitions. Of courese, The museum’s rich collections from all over the world are also closely related to the colonial expansion of the British Empire in the 18th and 19th centuries.Therefore, from a historical point of view, the expansion of the British Empire and the plunder during the colonial period is significant condition of possible for the large collection of the British Museum. Thanks to the development of digital technology, now we can access to the museum without being in London. So the collaboration with Google Cultural Institute makes online 3-D exihbition possible. In a nutshell, Colonial expansion of empires in history, government's financial support and the collaboration with tech-company are the main conditions of possibility for British Museum can exist.       </p>
