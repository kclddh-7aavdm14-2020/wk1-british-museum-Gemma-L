            and I majored in the specialty of 
            Regional Development in Rural Area in China Agriculture University.
             I chose to take classes remotely in the first semester, so now I am watching lectures 
             at home in Chongqing ( a southwest city built on mountains in China)</p>
        <h2>My favorite museums</h2>    
        <p> There are many museums that amaze me. For instance, <a href=http://www.cqbhl.com.cn/Info_Photos/vr720.aspwhite target=/blank> 
            <b>the underwater museum of crane ridge</b></a>in Chongqing, people can 
            view the cultural relics Which are submerged by the construction of the Three gorges
             dam. And I also like <b>Getty Center</b> in Los angles which collected a number of beautiful 
             and famous paintings.
             ( They also have a brilliant <a href=https://www.getty.edu/publications/virtuallibrary/?fbclid=IwAR0vM8uhvHEpsR0rEDm9A7NjCA5KP54QA9h3fnnwmlvz1h4ojVOQOeUBPYw target=/blank>online free library:)</a></p>
        <h2>My favorite website</h2>   
        <p> As for website, I want to recommend <a href=http://fff.cmiscm.com/#!/main target=/blank title="interaction animation">this</a> to you.
            There are many funny interactive animations in the website which makes me feel healing especially
             with the big screen. And this website is 
             about <a href=https://www.oldbookillustrations.comold target=/blank>books’ illustration</a>, all the pictures are sooooo beautiful.
            
            <br><br>
            As a Generation Z, I get information from different web almost every day,
             so it’s definitely fun to creat my own website. All in all, 
             I am soooo excited to take this course with you guys from diverse background.
             I am looking forward to start learning and meet U all. ^-^</p>
